## 1. Overview

The **PlantScan AI Backend** provides high-performance, modular endpoints for crop disease diagnosis, plant part classification, out-of-scope/uncertainty detection, and sustainable **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)** treatment recommendations.

### Key Architectural Principles
- **Engineering First**: Clean separation of API routing, service logic, inference engines, and knowledge bases.
- **Organic First**: Non-chemical cultural, biological, and preventive measures are prioritized before synthetic chemicals.
- **Responsible Diagnosis**: Ambiguous or out-of-scope images return explicit `uncertain` or `unsupported_crop` statuses rather than false confidence.
- **Scientific Sourcing**: All treatment advisories cite agricultural university extension manuals (e.g., ICAR, FAO, UC Davis IPM).

### 3.2 Uncertain / Low-Confidence Handling (`status: "uncertain"`)

When model diagnostic certainty is below the confidence threshold (`0.70`), the API safely rejects guesswork:

```json
{
  "status": "uncertain",
  "crop": "Tomato",
  "predicted_class": "tomato_early_blight",
  "display_name": "Uncertain Diagnosis",
  "confidence": 0.45,
  "is_healthy": false,
  "plant_part": "Leaf",
  "plant_health_score": 50,
  "recommendation": {
    "summary": "Diagnostic confidence (45.0%) is below the 70% threshold. Visual symptoms are ambiguous. Do not apply chemical pesticides without physical verification.",
    "organic": [
      {
        "name": "General Field Hygiene",
        "method": "Inspect adjacent plants for similar symptoms. Prune any visibly rotten or dead plant material using sterilized tools.",
        "application": "Morning hours",
        "frequency": "As needed during weekly monitoring",
        "caution_level": "Low"
      }
    ],
    "chemical": [],
    "prevention": [
      "Capture a clear, well-focused close-up photo of the affected plant part in natural daylight.",
      "Avoid applying broad-spectrum synthetic chemical pesticides without verified diagnostic confirmation.",
      "Take fresh physical plant samples to your nearest agricultural extension center or KVK."
    ],
    "safety_notes": [
      "When AI diagnostic confidence is below the threshold or visual features are ambiguous, avoid treating based on presumption."
    ],
    "photo_guidance": [
      "Ensure good natural daylight (avoid direct harsh midday sun or deep shadows).",
      "Focus sharply on the lesion or affected area.",
      "Include both the top surface and underside of the leaf if possible.",
      "Avoid taking photos with messy backgrounds, hands covering symptoms, or heavy motion blur."
    ],
    "disclaimer": "This advisory is generated by PlantScan AI for preliminary screening and educational purposes. Always consult your local agricultural extension service...",
    "sources": [
      "ICAR Extension Field Handbook",
      "FAO Integrated Pest Management Guidelines"
    ]
  },
  "model_version": "MobileNetV2-PlantScan-v1",
  "inference_time_ms": 18.2,
  "message": "Low diagnostic certainty. Follow the photo tips to retake a clear photo in natural light."
}
```

    response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)

result = response.json()
print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
print(f"Disease: {result['display_name']} (Confidence: {result['confidence']*100:.1f}%)")
print(f"Plant Health Score: {result['plant_health_score']}/100")

# Display Organic Remedies First
print("\n--- Organic Remedies ---")
for remedy in result["recommendation"]["organic"]:
    print(f"• {remedy['name']}: {remedy['method']}")
